;; fund-raiser.clar
;; A simple FundRaiser smart contract on Stacks blockchain using Clarity 4
;; This contract allows users to donate STX towards a funding goal, and the owner can withdraw once the goal is reached.

;; Define constants for immutable values
(define-constant CONTRACT-OWNER tx-sender)  ;; The deployer of the contract is the owner
(define-constant FUNDING-GOAL u1000000)     ;; Funding goal: 1 STX (1000000 microSTX)

;; Define data variables for mutable state
(define-data-var total-funded uint u0)      ;; Total amount funded so far, starts at 0

;; Define a map to track donor contributions
;; Key: donor principal, Value: total amount donated by that donor
(define-map donors principal uint)

;; Public function: fund
;; Allows any user to donate STX to the fundraiser
;; Parameters: amount (uint) - the amount of microSTX to donate
;; Returns: (response bool uint) - (ok true) on success, error code on failure
(define-public (fund (amount uint))

    ;; If donor doesn't exist, default to 0, then add the new amount
